==========

nice looking and easily customizable home page

the code is distributed with a donationware font Harabara. consider a 1$ donation whenever you decide to use the font: http://www.dafont.com/harabara.font

usage: inside boxcont div just add new <a> tags according to the template in index.html. optionally use "tekst" class for block descriptions

currently a row holds 3 wide blocks or 6 small blocks, and you can have 3 rows. small block has a 116x120 size, and wide block has 240x120 size, mind that while modifying css file to add more space, or while making backgrounds for blocks. the style is optimized for 1366x768 or more resolutions, for smaller resolutions just adjust size of boxcont and tweak floater.

example of usage (be creative! include some cool widgets like a clock):
